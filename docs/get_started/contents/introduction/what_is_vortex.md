The Vortex open environment allows everyone to create or work around innovative projects and tools centered around the concepts of healthy, reliable, efficient, and secure computing.

The project includes numerous software, initiatives, services, and a community that makes it easy for everyone to hack and do all kinds of powerful things.

## Parts of Vortex

|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|The **Vortex Launcher** is a simple and minimalist software that integrates all the tools related to managing projects, content, tools, and creations. It helps organize your projects and simplifies open-source collaboration within a healthy, ethical, and respectful environment. |

|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|The **Vortex Editor** is the central hub of Vortex. It allows you to open, use, and edit projects, tools, and a wide range of ideas. The editor’s role is to make the entire ecosystem work together while helping manage content and the various components of a project. It is highly modular, enabling developers to shape it to fit any use case. That’s why we call it an “open, free, and open-source platform.”|

|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|Currently in development, Infinite Labs will be a content platform that allows everyone to share and access content for creating a wide range of projects—including complex ones—but with the simplicity of a single click to create something complete and exciting!

| <img src="infinite_community.png" width="50" height="50" style="width:60px" /> Infinite Community (WIP) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|Currently in development, the community side of Vortex and Infinite will include a forum and dedicated spaces for showcasing projects, sharing content, hacks, and all kinds of creative ideas.|

## History


### Prequel
The Vortex story start in 2019. The project was created around "FZTOS" a modular operating system dedicated to hackers who want a modular operatring system based on Pacman package manager. The original goal of FZTOS was to give the power to people of creating every custom Linux based systems. With the goal of create homelabs, data storage systems, game system, etc. Anectote: "FZT" is for "FizzTeam", oriented around a old project names "CraftWorld", a old minecraft server created around 2017/2018 that not have a really big success.

Later, in 2020 FZTOS is renamed "InfiniteOS" to represent the infnite possibilities of this modular system.

### Beginings of Vortex
Create a operating system is interesting and cool, but creating a modular one is pretty complex, to help modulartiy, weve created "The Vortex Scripts", theses scripts help to build a custom build of InfiniteOS with specified parameters including distribution managment like rolling release.
In 2022 Vortex scripts are at this time pretty cool, but if we need them, others will probably need them too. Well, weve created the Vortex Creation Platform, allowing everyone to create their own hacky systems !

### Vortex now
Vortex is now a advanced creation platform. This project allow the creation of systems, apps, services & devices, but it's also allow everyone to use tools, debugers, diag tools and more. Data is project oriented, so every Vortex project can have their own purposes and goals.
