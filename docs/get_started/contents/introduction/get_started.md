We previously saw how to install the Launcher, once installed, everything is ready! Let’s get started.

### Understand Vortex

The Vortex creative platform includes several elements that allow you to create, share content, and explore new creative possibilities. Let’s go over the main components of the Vortex project.

The Vortex Launcher is the central software of the platform. It allows you to create and manage your projects, as well as install new versions of the editor, including demo versions.

The Vortex Editor is the software launched by the launcher that allows you to interact with your projects.
