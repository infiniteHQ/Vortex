- Install multiple Vortex versions simultaneously to maintain compatibility with older projects.  
- Open legacy projects or modules, even those created by others.  
- Seamlessly work across different Vortex versions with maximum convenience.

Through a single interface, you can install or delete official and custom versions of Vortex, ensuring efficient management of your projects.
