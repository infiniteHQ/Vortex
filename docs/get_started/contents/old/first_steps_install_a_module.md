### Install a Module

Vortex allows you to install modules directly onto your system, making them accessible in your projects.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:  
> Installing a module on your system does not mean it will automatically work in your projects.  
> *(To learn more: See the concept of Modules).*  
> Vortex uses a project-based approach for your content, meaning that modules function inside your projects, not directly from your system!

However, Vortex allows you to install modules onto your system for the purpose of quickly adding them to your projects later. The modules installed on your system will be available for use in projects, depending on the editor's compatibility.

So, if a module is installed and functioning within your project but is not installed on the system, it will still work. Conversely, if a module is installed on the system but not included in a project, it will not work.

To install a module on your system and make it available for your projects, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Launcher**  
   Go to the **Logical Content Manager**.

2. **Import a Module**  
   Navigate to the **"Import a Module"** section and choose a directory, or search for new modules (for example, the "Downloads" folder if the modules come from the internet).

3. **Select Modules**  
   During and after the search, you'll see the found modules displayed as cards. Select the modules you want to add to your system.

4. **Import the Modules**  
   After selecting the modules, click **Import**. A confirmation window will appear, and you can click **Import** again to finalize the process.

> 🔧 **NOTE**:  
> Although the module is now installed on your system, it won't function in your project until it's specifically added to it. Make sure to include the module within your project for it to work correctly.  

Now, the selected modules will be imported into your system and ready to be added to your projects.
