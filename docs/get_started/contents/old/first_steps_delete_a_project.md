### Delete a Project

To delete a project from your system, launch the Vortex Launcher. Click on the desired project and then click **Delete**. Once clicked, a confirmation window will appear asking you to re-enter the project name. Once the name matches, the **Delete** button will become active, and you can proceed by clicking it.


> ⚠️ **Warning**:  
> Once you click **Delete**, the project will be permanently removed, and this action is irreversible. The project will not be sent to your system's recycle bin.  
> Vortex does not keep any attachments to individual projects. You can also manually delete a project by removing its installation folder, but be aware that this will also permanently erase the project.


Although the Vortex Launcher properly deletes projects, you can also manually and permanently delete a project by removing its folder from where it is installed. Vortex does not keep any attachments to individual projects.
