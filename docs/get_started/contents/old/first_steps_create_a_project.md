### Create a Project

To create a new project, launch the Vortex Launcher and go to the **Project Management** window. In the action bar, select **"Create a New Project."**

Once on the project creation page, you will see several large sections on the right side: **"All Templates,"** **"Creative,"** **"Tools,"** and **"Maintenance."** These sections contain all the templates installed on your system. In the **"All"** section, you can filter templates to find the one you're looking for.

For this example, we will select the basic empty template.

To create this empty project, click on the template icon. On the right side, you will see the details of your new project. Here, you will need to fill in some basic information, such as:
- **Project Name**
- **Project Version**
- **Author Name**
- **Description**

You will also need to choose a version of Vortex. The versions available correspond to the versions supported by the template (not the ones you have installed). However, if you create a project with an unsupported or uninstalled version, the Vortex Launcher will automatically offer to install it for you to ensure the project runs correctly.

Once you've entered the required information, you can check the option **"Open the project after creation"** to launch the editor directly.

By clicking **"Create Project,"** the new project will be created.

Now, the newly created project will be visible in the project management section of the launcher. If it’s the most recent project you’ve created, the welcome window will offer to open it quickly for you.
