### Install a Plugin

Like modules, plugins can be installed on your system to be made available for addition to your projects. Installing a plugin on your system does not mean it will automatically function in the editor, but rather it makes the plugin available for use within your projects.

To install a plugin on your system and make it available in your projects, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Launcher**  
   Go to the **Logical Content Manager**.

2. **Import a Plugin**  
   Navigate to the **"Import a Plugin"** section and select a directory, or search for new plugins (for example, the "Downloads" folder if the plugins come from the internet).

3. **Select Plugins**  
   During and after the search, you will see the found plugins displayed as cards. Select the plugins you want to add to your system.

4. **Import the Plugins**  
   After selecting the plugins, click **Import**. A confirmation window will appear, and you can click **Import** again to finalize the process.

> ðŸ”§ **NOTE**:  
> Although the plugin is now installed on your system, it won't function in your project until it's specifically added to it. Make sure to include the plugin within your project for it to work correctly.

Now, the selected plugins will be imported into your system and ready to be added to your projects.
