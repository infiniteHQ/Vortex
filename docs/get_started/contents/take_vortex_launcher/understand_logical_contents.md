### Modules
Modules are the fundamental building blocks of the editor. They add core functionalities at the lowest level of the editor. For example, they allow you to add basic toolsâ€”such as tools for creating systems or debugging binaries.

### Plugins
Plugins are simpler, more portable logical elements that run at a higher level. They allow you to add, patch, or change the functionality of the core modules and editor. They let you modify or adapt modules without having to alter them directly.
