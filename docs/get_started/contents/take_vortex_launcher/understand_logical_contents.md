Logical content consists of modular components that add features to a project and the Vortex Editor. The Vortex Editor alone simply provides the project context and enables all logical and static content to communicate with each other. The editor guarantees interoperability between components. It allows all parts to interact and provides essential utilities like content managers, project settings, and the content browser—along with logging and debugging tools.

### Modules
Modules are the fundamental building blocks of the editor. They add core functionalities at the lowest level of the editor. For example, they allow you to add basic tools—such as tools for creating systems or debugging binaries.

### Plugins
Plugins are simpler, more portable logical elements that run at a higher level. They allow you to add, patch, or change the functionality of the core modules and editor. They let you modify or adapt modules without having to alter them directly.
