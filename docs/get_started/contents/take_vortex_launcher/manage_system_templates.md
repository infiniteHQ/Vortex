### Install a template

Vortex allows you to install templates directly onto your system, making them accessible in your projects or at the project creation (to start with a base).

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:  
> Installing a template on your system does not mean it will automatically work in your projects.  
> *(To learn more: See the concept of templates).*  
> Vortex uses a project-based approach for your content, meaning that templates function inside your projects, not directly from your system!

However, Vortex allows you to install templates onto your system for the purpose of quickly adding them to your projects later. The templates installed on your system will be available for use in projects, depending on the editor's compatibility.

So, if a template is installed and functioning within your project but is not installed on the system, it will still work. Conversely, if a template is installed on the system but not included in a project, it will not work.

To install a template on your system and make it available for your projects, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Launcher**  
   Go to the **static Content Manager**.

2. **Import a template**  
   Navigate to the **"Import a Template"** section and choose a directory, or search for new templates (for example, the "Downloads" folder if the templates come from the internet).

3. **Select templates**  
   During and after the search, you'll see the found templates displayed as cards. Select the templates you want to add to your system.

4. **Import the templates**  
   After selecting the templates, click **Import**. A confirmation window will appear, and you can click **Import** again to finalize the process.

> 🔧 **NOTE**:  
> Although the template is now installed on your system, it won't function in your project until it's specifically added to it. Make sure to include the template within your project for it to work correctly.  

Now, the selected templates will be imported into your system and ready to be added to your projects.


### Delete a template
> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:  
> Deleting a template on your system does not mean it will be deleted from your projects.  
> *(To learn more: See the concept of templates).*  
> Vortex uses a project-based approach for your content, meaning that templates function inside your projects, not directly from your system!

To delete a template from your system, launch the Vortex Launcher. Open the static content manager and click on "templates". Then, searcch th template you want to delete from your system, and click on the Trash icon. When the confirmation modal is open, click on "Confirm Delete"


> ⚠️ **Warning**:  
> Once you click **Delete**, the template will be permanently removed form system, and this action is irreversible. The template will not be sent to your system's recycle bin.  
> Vortex does not keep any attachments to individual projects. You can also manually delete a template by removing its directly on a project, via the Vortex Editor template manager, but be aware that this will also permanently erase the template.


Although the Vortex Launcher properly deletes templates, you can also manually and permanently delete a templates by removing its folder from where it is installed. Vortex does not keep any attachments to individual moudles installed in the system.
