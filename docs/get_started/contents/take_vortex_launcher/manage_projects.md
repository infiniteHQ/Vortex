## Introduction
The Vortex Launcher is designed first and foremost to help you manage your projects and tools in a centralized and simplified way. It makes it easy to create, open, or import any project.

## Create a project
To create a project, go to the Project Manager and click on “Create a New Project” (or simply click on “Create a Project” directly from the Welcome Menu).

Once the project creation utility is visible, <span style="color:#F80F80">**select a template**</span> to base your new project on. By default, only the empty template is available, but you can also install additional templates to start projects from an existing base.

<banner type="note">To install new templates or create your own, see the [Templates section](https://i.n:content_name=take_vortex_launcher&section=get_started&page_name=manage_system_templates).</banner>


Once the project base is selected, your new project will appear in the panel on the right and you will be able to <span style="color:#F7A41D">**create the project**</span>. There, you can set the name and choose which version of the Vortex Editor to use with your project. You can also specify which project pool the new project should be created in.

Il est optionnel, mais tout a fait possible d'ajouter plus de param_tres a la creation de votre projets, tels que author, description, a custom version. Pour cela il suffit juste de clicker sur la <span style="color:#F80F80">**roue dentée**</span>  et inscrire ses paramètres dans le <span style="color:#F80F80">**tableau des paramètres**</span>.

When everything is ready, clicking the <span style="color:#F7A41D">**Create project**</span> button will create your new project.

## Open a project
To open an existing project on your system, simply go to the Project Manager, click on the project you want, then click the "Open" button at the bottom right. Please note the project must already exist on your system.

You can also click the “Open a Project” button directly from the Welcome Menu.

<banner type="note">If you don’t see a project that’s already on your system, you’ll need to import it into a Vortex project folder. We use these folders to create a clear and organized working environment.</banner>

## Import a project
The Vortex Launcher allows you to import projects so you can easily open projects created by others. Vortex’s approach to project-oriented content and modules means you don’t have to do a lot of setup to launch the project—everything the project needs is included, as long as the creator has exported the entire project.

<banner type="note">Please import only projects from trusted or reputable sources, as malicious users could introduce harmful modules.</banner>

To import a project, click on <span style="color:#F80F80">**Import project**</span>.  Then, the file and folder manager will open, showing only Vortex-compatible projects. Navigate to the folder containing your project and select it. You can also choose the project pool (the location where the project will be installed). By clicking <span style="color:#F7A41D">**import**</span>, the project will be copied into the selected pool.

##### Import a project manually
You can also import a project manually by simply copying a Vortex-compatible project into one of the pools that the Launcher monitors to list projects. To see the pools, go to the Project Manager and click on “Project Pools.”

### Delete a project
To delete a project, click on the project you want to remove, then click on “Delete Project.” You will then be asked to type the project’s name to confirm its deletion.

<banner type="warning">A project deleted this way will be permanently removed.</banner>

##### Delete a project manually
You can also delete a project manually directly from your system where the project is stored. Vortex doesn’t store your projects in any other way—like in a registry or elsewhere—it only knows your projects through the project pools.
for storing your projects (project pools), simply go to the Project Manager and click on “Project Pools.” A small menu will open where you can add new locations to create and store your projects.

You can also configure your pools from Vortex’s general settings, under the “Paths” section.

### Set custom project folders
To add more project pools locations, simply click on "Search folders" from the menubar, this will open a window of all folder where Vortex will search projects.
You can then, add or remove project folders and save.
