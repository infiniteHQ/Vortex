### Introduction
The Vortex Launcher is designed first and foremost to help you manage your projects and tools in a centralized and simplified way. It makes it easy to create, open, or import any project.

### Create a project
To create a project, go to the Project Manager and click on “Create a New Project” (or simply click on “Create a Project” directly from the Welcome Menu).

Once the project creation utility is visible, select a template to base your new project on. By default, only the empty template is available, but you can also install additional templates to start projects from an existing base.

Once the project base is selected, your new project will appear in the panel on the right. There, you can set the name, author, description, a custom version, and choose which version of the Vortex Editor to use with your project. You can also specify which project pool the new project should be created in.

When everything is ready, clicking the “Create Project” button will create your new project.

### Open a project
To open an existing project on your system, simply go to the Project Manager, click on the project you want, then click the "Open" button at the bottom right. Please note the project must already exist on your system.

You can also click the “Open a Project” button directly from the Welcome Menu.

### Import a project
The Vortex Launcher allows you to import projects so you can easily open projects created by others. Vortex’s approach to project-oriented content and modules means you don’t have to do a lot of setup to launch the project—everything the project needs is included, as long as the creator has exported the entire project.

To import a project, click on “Import Project.” Then, the file and folder manager will open, showing only Vortex-compatible projects. Navigate to the folder containing your project and select it. You can also choose the project pool (the location where the project will be installed). By clicking “Import,” the project will be copied into the selected pool.

##### Import a project manually
You can also import a project manually by simply copying a Vortex-compatible project into one of the pools that the Launcher monitors to list projects. To see the pools, go to the Project Manager and click on “Project Pools.”

### Delete a project
To delete a project, click on the project you want to remove, then click on “Delete Project.” You will then be asked to type the project’s name to confirm its deletion.

##### Delete a project manually
You can also delete a project manually directly from your system where the project is stored. Vortex doesn’t store your projects in any other way—like in a registry or elsewhere—it only knows your projects through the project pools.

### Set custom project folders
To add more locations for storing your projects (project pools), simply go to the Project Manager and click on “Project Pools.” A small menu will open where you can add new locations to create and store your projects.

You can also configure your pools from Vortex’s general settings, under the “Paths” section.
