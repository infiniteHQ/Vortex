To check if an update is available, simply click on the Vortex menu, then select “Update the Launcher.” Once clicked, an update utility will launch and inform you if an update is available. Note that this requires an internet connection to contact Vortex’s official update servers.

### Update notifications
When the launcher detects an update by contacting Vortex’s update servers, it will display a notification in the bottom right corner saying a new version of the Launcher is available. An “Update” button allows you to update the Launcher directly.
