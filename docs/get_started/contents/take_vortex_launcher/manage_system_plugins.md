### Install a plugin

Vortex allows you to install plugins directly onto your system, making them accessible in your projects.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:  
> Installing a plugin on your system does not mean it will automatically work in your projects.  
> *(To learn more: See the concept of plugins).*  
> Vortex uses a project-based approach for your content, meaning that plugins function inside your projects, not directly from your system!

However, Vortex allows you to install plugins onto your system for the purpose of quickly adding them to your projects later. The plugins installed on your system will be available for use in projects, depending on the editor's compatibility.

So, if a plugin is installed and functioning within your project but is not installed on the system, it will still work. Conversely, if a plugin is installed on the system but not included in a project, it will not work.

To install a plugin on your system and make it available for your projects, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Launcher**  
   Go to the **Logical Content Manager**.

2. **Import a plugin**  
   Navigate to the **"Import a plugin"** section and choose a directory, or search for new plugins (for example, the "Downloads" folder if the plugins come from the internet).

3. **Select plugins**  
   During and after the search, you'll see the found plugins displayed as cards. Select the plugins you want to add to your system.

4. **Import the plugin**  
   After selecting the plugins, click **Import**. A confirmation window will appear, and you can click **Import** again to finalize the process.

> 🔧 **NOTE**:  
> Although the plugin is now installed on your system, it won't function in your project until it's specifically added to it. Make sure to include the plugin within your project for it to work correctly.  

Now, the selected plugins will be imported into your system and ready to be added to your projects.


### Delete a plugin
> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:  
> Deleting a plugin on your system does not mean it will be deleted from your projects.  
> *(To learn more: See the concept of plugins).*  
> Vortex uses a project-based approach for your content, meaning that plugins function inside your projects, not directly from your system!

To delete a plugin from your system, launch the Vortex Launcher. Open the logical content manager and click on "plugins". Then, searcch th plugin you want to delete from your system, and click on the Trash icon. When the confirmation modal is open, click on "Confirm Delete"


> ⚠️ **Warning**:  
> Once you click **Delete**, the plugin will be permanently removed form system, and this action is irreversible. The plugin will not be sent to your system's recycle bin.  
> Vortex does not keep any attachments to individual projects. You can also manually delete a plugin by removing its directly on a project, via the Vortex Editor plugin manager, but be aware that this will also permanently erase the plugin.


Although the Vortex Launcher properly deletes plugins, you can also manually and permanently delete a plugins by removing its folder from where it is installed. Vortex does not keep any attachments to individual moudles installed in the system.
