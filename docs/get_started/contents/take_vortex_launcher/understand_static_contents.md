Static content consists of elements you can create, import, and export—often with the help of modules or plugins. These contents are frequently interactive within the content browser.

### Contents
“Content” refers to the elements that make up your project. They can be system components, code, diagrams, blueprints or other assets. In any case, they aren’t logical content providing direct functionality but rather serve as the building blocks that constitute a tool or project.

### Templates
Templates are content used as a foundation for creating other content. They help you quickly create and start parts of a project and automate repetitive or time-consuming processes.
