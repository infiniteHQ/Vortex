The Vortex Launcher lets you manage the versions of the Editor installed on your system—it allows you to install, import, update, or remove them. The Vortex Editor is used to launch, run, and edit a tool or project. We separate versions and allow multiple ones to coexist so that all tools and projects can work together, regardless of their version or compatibility. The launcher acts as a central hub for managing and installing different versions of the Vortex Editor.

### Install a version
<banner type="note">If you launch a project that requires a version not currently installed, the launcher will automatically offer to install it for you—if that version is available for download. You’ll only need to add or import versions manually if you don’t have an internet connection or if the version is unknown. See how to import an editor version in this page at "Import a version".</banner>

To install a version of the Vortex Editor, start the Vortex Version utility, then go to the “Install a New Version” section. In this section, you’ll see all the available versions.
To access additional versions—such as beta or demo releases—make sure to subscribe to the appropriate programs. [See how to join programs.](https://i.n:content_name=take_vortex_launcher&section=get_started&page_name=subscribe_to_beta)

To install a specific version from the available ones, click the “+ Install” button. This will launch the Vortex Editor installation utility for the selected version. Choose the installation location for the editor and click “Install.” The editor will then be installed, and the Vortex Launcher will detect it as an available version.

Once installed, you’ll be able to launch projects and tools with that version and manage the editor installation from the Vortex Version Manager, under the “Installed Versions” tab.

### Reinstall a version
You can reinstall a version of Vortex if needed. To do this, open the Vortex Launcher and the Vortex Version Manager utility, go to the “Installed Versions” tab, and click the “Reinstall” button. This button is only available if the version is downloadable and you have an active internet connection.

### Delete a version
To delete a version of the editor, open the Vortex Launcher and launch the Vortex Version utility. Then, go to the “Installed Versions” tab, click on the trash icon next to the version you want to remove, and confirm the deletion by clicking “Confirm Delete” in the confirmation modal.

### Import a version
You can also manually import a version—this is useful when the version you need isn’t available on Infinite’s official servers or if you’re working offline. To do this, open the Vortex Launcher and the Vortex Version Manager, click on “Install New Version,” then select “Import a Version.” The file/folder manager will open, showing only importable Vortex versions. Once you find a compatible version, select it and click “Import Version” to add it.
