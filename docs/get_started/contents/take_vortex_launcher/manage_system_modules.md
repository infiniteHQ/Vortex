### Install a Module

Vortex allows you to install modules directly onto your system, making them accessible in your projects.

However, Vortex allows you to install modules onto your system for the purpose of quickly adding them to your projects later. The modules installed on your system will be available for use in projects, depending on the editor's compatibility.

So, if a module is installed and functioning within your project but is not installed on the system, it will still work. Conversely, if a module is installed on the system but not included in a project, it will not work.

To install a module on your system and make it available for your projects, follow these steps:

<banner type="note">Although the module is now installed on your system, it won't function in your project until it's specifically added to it. Make sure to include the module within your project for it to work correctly.  </banner>


Now, the selected modules will be imported into your system and ready to be added to your projects.

> ⚠️ **Warning**:  
> Once you click **Delete**, the module will be permanently removed form system, and this action is irreversible. The module will not be sent to your system's recycle bin.  
> Vortex does not keep any attachments to individual projects. You can also manually delete a module by removing its directly on a project, via the Vortex Editor Module manager, but be aware that this will also permanently erase the module.


Although the Vortex Launcher properly deletes modules, you can also manually and permanently delete a modules by removing its folder from where it is installed. Vortex does not keep any attachments to individual moudles installed in the system.
