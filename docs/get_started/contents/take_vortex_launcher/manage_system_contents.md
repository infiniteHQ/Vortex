### Install a content

What is a content ? 

Vortex allows you to install contents directly onto your system, making them accessible in your projects or at the project creation.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:  
> Installing a content on your system does not mean it will automatically work in your projects.  
> *(To learn more: See the concept of contents).*  
> Vortex uses a project-based approach for your content, meaning that contents function inside your projects, not directly from your system!

However, Vortex allows you to install contents onto your system for the purpose of quickly adding them to your projects later. The contents installed on your system will be available for use in projects, depending on the editor's compatibility.

So, if a content is installed and functioning within your project but is not installed on the system, it will still work. Conversely, if a content is installed on the system but not included in a project, it will not work.

To install a content on your system and make it available for your projects, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Launcher**  
   Go to the **static Content Manager**.

2. **Import a content**  
   Navigate to the **"Import a content"** section and choose a directory, or search for new contents (for example, the "Downloads" folder if the contents come from the internet).

3. **Select contents**  
   During and after the search, you'll see the found contents displayed as cards. Select the contents you want to add to your system.

4. **Import the contents**  
   After selecting the contents, click **Import**. A confirmation window will appear, and you can click **Import** again to finalize the process.

> 🔧 **NOTE**:  
> Although the content is now installed on your system, it won't function in your project until it's specifically added to it. Make sure to include the content within your project for it to work correctly.  

Now, the selected contents will be imported into your system and ready to be added to your projects.


### Delete a content
> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:  
> Deleting a content on your system does not mean it will be deleted from your projects.  
> *(To learn more: See the concept of contents).*  
> Vortex uses a project-based approach for your content, meaning that contents function inside your projects, not directly from your system!

To delete a content from your system, launch the Vortex Launcher. Open the static content manager and click on "contents". Then, searcch th content you want to delete from your system, and click on the Trash icon. When the confirmation modal is open, click on "Confirm Delete"


> ⚠️ **Warning**:  
> Once you click **Delete**, the content will be permanently removed form system, and this action is irreversible. The content will not be sent to your system's recycle bin.  
> Vortex does not keep any attachments to individual projects. You can also manually delete a content by removing its directly on a project, via the Vortex Editor content manager, but be aware that this will also permanently erase the content.


Although the Vortex Launcher properly deletes contents, you can also manually and permanently delete a contents by removing its folder from where it is installed. Vortex does not keep any attachments to individual moudles installed in the system.
