### Install a Project

Vortex allows you to create your own projects, but it also enables you to install projects from external sources.  
To install a new project, make sure the project you want to install is present on your system.

1. **Open the Launcher**  
   Go to the **Project Management** window and click on **"Import a Project"** next to the **"Create a Project"** button.

2. **Select the Project Directory**  
   Choose the directory that contains the project you want to install. The search will begin, and you will see a list of all installable projects.

3. **Select and Import**  
   Click on the project(s) you wish to install, then click **Import**. A confirmation window will appear asking you to confirm your action.

Once confirmed, the project will be copied to your project's directory. After that, the source project can be deleted, as it has already been copied to the installation directory.
