### Open a Project

To open a project, whether it's one you've created or from an external source, simply go to the **Project Manager**. There, you will see a list of all the projects installed on your system.

To open a project, click on it, and in the sidebar, click **Open**. If the project is already open, a window will notify you. Note that you can open a single project in multiple editors, but **be cautious**: some modules may not work properly if opened multiple times in different editors.
