# Introduction

### Summary

Vortex is an open, free, and open-source platform designed for creators of all kinds. It empowers users to create, transform, repair, or enhance a wide variety of projects and ideas. Whether you aim to bring dreams and concepts to life or simply need tools for diagnostics and repairs, Vortex makes it possible.

### Freedom, Openness, and Open Source

Vortex is a fully open, hackable, free, and open-source project. These values are crucial to us and our community, ensuring the project's transparency, health, and most importantly, its creative and innovative potential. A private project would not offer the same level of freedom to allow individuals in the community to modify and adapt the software to their unique needs.

### No Private or Profit-Driven Interests

Like Infinite, Vortex is not a profit-driven project but a technological initiative. Above all, we are passionate individuals committed to building safe, reliable technology and powerful tools that bring maximum benefits to users while respecting them and their environment.

That said, it’s evident that such a project involves significant costs and requires funding. To address this, we welcome sponsorships and plan to sell ethical and open hardware to help everyone bring their projects to life. [(Learn more about funding)].
