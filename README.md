### What is Hypernet ?

Hypernet is a programmable and flexible technology that significantly enhances the security, reliability, efficiency, and functionality of an application, service, or platform. It introduces a new computing paradigm and innovative concepts.

### Hypernet: A New Computing Paradigm

Hypernet aims to provide solutions and responses within a new computing paradigm, centered around the service environment. This paradigm revolves around the following concepts: decentralization, federation, integration, and implementation.

- Decentralization: The Hypernet paradigm is built on new concepts, architectures, and protocols surrounding the decentralization of services, users, and associated data. This approach provides a more reliable and secure framework while offering potential in terms of functionality or even the immediacy of actions.

- Federation: This paradigm also enables the coexistence of various concepts or applications in a simple and organized manner. It allows the operation of things that may not initially work together.

- Integration: Environment integration forms a reliable, efficient, and secure symbiosis, aiming to seamlessly integrate services within the same environment. It also ensures the complete integration of a user into their environment.

- Implementation: Implementing Hypernet enhances the capabilit/ies of systems or services. For example, integrating Hypernet into a microcontroller adds numerous features such as complex databases, remote functions, and more. In general, implementing functionalities adds content or features to a service.

- Programming: Hypernet is designed to be a programmable, flexible, and modular protocol, allowing optimal management of the elements constituting the protocols and concepts employed to adapt its technology to any challenge.
